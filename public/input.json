  "aboutMe": "Hi! I'm Jonathan, a CS student @ Stanford! I'm passionate about full-stack and software development, and I love working on projects that make a real-world impact. I find it extremely fulfilling to identify people's needs and build efficient, intuitive products that meet them!\n\nIn my free time, I like to workout, run, and catch up on the latest trending movies and shows (I'm also a chronic doomscroller but we don't talk about that) I've been playing percussion since 6th grade and piano since the age of 5, and I'm currently a percussionist in the Stanford Symphony Orchestra. I listen to all kinds of music - from classical, to The Weeknd, to Julian Casablancas, to Jeff Buckley, to video game/movie soundtracks, etc. etc... I'm also a huge foodie and always down to grab a bite somewhere new (add me on Beli!!)\n\nAdd my socials :)\nInstagram: @yonaseen\nBeli: @yonaseen",
